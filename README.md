- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ConnerGoldberg,

I am the founder and director of Ascension Cloud Solutions. I primarily specialize in work utilizing ASP .NET and Node.js.

I have worked on many different types of applications including energy cost/consumption analytics for Australian Council Data Warehouses to Kanban boards for 
managing workflow, and fitness/prepping apps involving microservices and payment gateways. If you require consulting on a project or
require a custom application to be built, feel free to contact me at: conner@ascensioncloudsolutions.com for a free consultation.
